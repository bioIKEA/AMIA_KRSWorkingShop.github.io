    <h2>About this workshop</h2>
    <p>The utilization of large language models (LLMs) and prompting has witnessed a surge in popularity over the past few years, particularly in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and chatbots. A prime example of this is ChatGPT, a sophisticated conversational agent powered by LLMs, which has become increasingly prevalent in a range of industries, including healthcare.</p>
    <p>The healthcare industry has experienced a significant shift towards digitization, resulting in vast amounts of medical data that can be challenging to manage and analyze. NLP has emerged as a critical tool in this regard, enabling the extraction of relevant information from medical records and related documents.</p>
    <p>With the aid of LLMs and prompting, NLP has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by facilitating faster and more accurate analysis of medical data, leading to improved patient outcomes and more effective treatments. Applications include clinical decision support systems, where LLMs can assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions based on the patient’s history and symptoms.</p>
    <p>Despite the benefits, concerns remain regarding data privacy, ethics, and bias due to the nature of training data. Addressing these concerns with appropriate safeguards is essential to fully leverage the potential of LLMs in healthcare.</p>
    <p>This workshop will cover technologies and use cases of LLMs in biomedical and healthcare domains, and address the challenges associated with their implementation. Attendees will gain insights into cutting-edge developments and their impact on patient care.</p>
